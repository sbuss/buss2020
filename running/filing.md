Filing for office is the first step.

# Step 0 - Don't spend any money

You can't spend or raise any money until step 4. Don't buy a domain name
or website, or set up a phone or paid email address for your campaign until
then.

# Step 1 - Pick a committee name

It can be anything that adequately describes what your committee is for.
I picked "Steven Buss for Democratic County Central Committee 2020"

# Step 2 - Declaration of Intent

The first form to fill out is the Declaration of Intent to Solicit
and Receive Contributions. This is not available online. You must go to the
SF Department of Elections and fill it out in person.

You need your name, address, phone number, and chosen committee name. The
staff at the Department of Elections will assist you in person.

Make it your first campaign photo op. Invite friends to be there when you
take the first step. You may want to skip to Step 5 and make a Facebook page
so you can promote it, like [I did](https://www.facebook.com/events/555816524822609/).

Technically, you are now able to raise money, but I think you should wait
until step 5. If you choose to raise now, you must file your 410 within a 
few days of raising $2,000.

# Step 3 - Form 501 (Candidate Intention Statement)

Download and fill out Form 501: [Candidate Intention Statement](http://www.fppc.ca.gov/content/dam/fppc/NS-Documents/TAD/Campaign%20Forms/501.pdf)

This is your first piece of paperwork for SF Ethics. You should file it
immediately after your Declaration of Intent (not because you _must_, but
because you **shouldn't waste any time**).

1. Check the "initial" box
1. Your name is `Last, First M.`
1. Fill in your address. It will be censored when made available online.
1. Fill in your phone number. It will be a public record.
1. Fill in your email address. It will be a public record.
1. Office sought: Democratic County Central Committee
1. Agency Name: City & County of San Francisco, CA
1. District Number:
    * East side: AD 17
    * West side: AD 19
1. Office Jurisdiction: County
1. Year of Election: 2020
1. Check "Primary/General" election type
1. Skip section 2, it does not apply to DCCC

Bring this to the SF Ethics department at 25 Van Ness Ave #220. Sign and date it there.

You can view my completed 501 in this repo: [501-filled.pdf](501-filled.pdf)

# Step 4 - Form 410: Statement of Organization Recipient Committee

Download and fill out [Form 410: Statement of Organization Recipient Committee](http://www.fppc.ca.gov/content/dam/fppc/NS-Documents/TAD/Campaign%20Forms/410.pdf)

You must file this form with both SF Ethics (in-person) and the Secretary of
State (via snail mail). You must mail the original, not a copy.

If you have not yet raised $2,000:

1. Check "Initial"
1. Check "Not yet qualified"

If you have raised $2,000:

1. Check "Initial"
1. Check "Date qualification threshold met" and fill in the appropriate
   date. **NOTE**: Since you qualified, you **MUST** have a bank account to
   proceed.


**Section 1: Committee information**

1. Name of Committee is what you chose on your Declaration of Intent. Mine is
   "Steven Buss for Democratic County Central Committee"
1. Fill in your personal address, phone number, and email. Like the 501, your
   address will be censored but your phone and email will become public record.
1. County of Domicile: San Francisco
1. Jurisdiction where committee is active: San Francisco

**Section 2: Treasurer and Other Principle Officers**

I am serving as my own treasurer until I raise a significant amount of money.
When this changes I will file an amended 410. You can do the same.

1. Fill in your name, address, and phone number for the treasurer information.
   As before, the address will be censored.

No other fields are required for your intial filing unless they are relevant to
your circumstances.

**Section 3: Verification**

Do not sign or date this until you are at SF Ethics. You will sign and date the
first two lines (treasurer and candidate).

On the top of page 2, in the financial informaion section:

If you have not yet raised $2,000 and do not yet have a bank account:

1. Name of financial institution: Pending
1. Bank account number: Pending

If you have raised $2,000, you **MUST** have a bank account:

1. Fill in all of information for your bank account

**Section 4: Type of Committee**

You will only fill out the "Controlled Committee" sub-section

1. Name of Candidate: Your name
1. Elective Office Sought: Democratic County Central Committee San Francisco, Assembly District 17
1. Year of election: 2020
1. Check "Partisan"
1. Political Party: Democratic

_IMPORTANT_: You cannot use any abbreviations on this form. So yes, you must
write out "Democratic County Central Committee" and not "DCCC".

You are done filling out your 410.

You can view my completed 410 in this repo: [410-filled.pdf](410-filled.pdf)

Bring this to SF Ethics at the same time as your 501. Sign and date it. They
will make a copy and give you an unstamped envelope with which to mail your
**original form** to 

    Secretary of State
    Political Reform Division
    1500 11th Street, Rm 495
    Sacramento, CA 95814

I recommend making another copy for your own records before you mail the
original.

# Step 5 - Wait for your FPPC ID number

The Secretary of State will process your 410 very quickly. I mailed mine on
Tuesday and by Friday afternoon I had my FPPC ID number.

## While you're waiting...

**NOTE** I don't yet know if you can spend personal money on buying a domain and
setting up a website. I _think_ you can but I need to consult with a lawyer first.
You should just use the free option until you:

1. Have your FPPC ID 
1. Have a bank account for your committee
1. Have donated to yourself so you have money to spend

### Sign up for Act Blue.

[Sign up as a candidate](https://secure.actblue.com/pending_entities/new).
They will respond within a day saying they need your FPPC
ID number. As soon as you get it, email it back to Act Blue support and you'll
be good to go.

### Create a campaign website

I used squarespace. It's excellent and easy to use. You can create a site before
paying.

You **MUST** include a campaign disclosure on your website. It looks like this:

"Paid for by Steven Buss for Democratic County Central Committee 2020.
Financial disclosures are available at sfethics.org"

### Create a Facebook page for yourself as a politician

[Create a public figure Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/creation/).
Don't mark yourself as a candidate for the race, that will mean you can't easily
reuse the page for future runs. Just make a page for yourself, [here's mine](https://www.facebook.com/Steven-Buss-2288531267904609).

You **MUST** include a campaign disclosure on your page. It looks like this:

"Paid for by Steven Buss for Democratic County Central Committee 2020.
Financial disclosures are available at sfethics.org"

# Step 6 - Get your FPPC ID number and create a donation page on Act Blue

You can check for your FPPC ID number online, at
[http://cal-access.sos.ca.gov](http://cal-access.sos.ca.gov). Click in the
small search box in the top left and type the name of your committee (or part
of the name). For example, by searching
["Buss 2020"](http://cal-access.sos.ca.gov/Misc/filerSearch.aspx?SEARCH=Buss+2020)
I can find my [records](http://cal-access.sos.ca.gov/Campaign/Committees/Detail.aspx?id=1419652).

When I got my FPPC ID number, I mailed it to Act Blue support (via an existing
support email chain) and they activated my account within an hour. The account
came with an automatically created donation page.

Act Blue doesn't know the local rules, so they have no contribution limit set.
Email support again requesting that they set your maximum contribution to $500.

YOU CAN NOW RAISE MONEY! SHARE THAT LINK AND START MAKING CALLS!

# Step 7 - Create a Bank Account

I haven't done this yet. Stand by for more updates as I learn them.
